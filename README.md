# Background
Growing concerns about crude oil depletion and environmental
impact are driving a crucial shift towards alternative energy sources.
Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining prominence due to their
environmental advantages, despite initial purchase costs. Major
automotive manufacturers are transitioning to hybrid and all-electric
models. However, successful EV market penetration requires robust
battery charging infrastructure. Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)
systems, especially Wireless Inductive Power Transfer (IPT), offer
cable-free charging solutions with advantages spanning various
applications. This includes mobile phones, biomedical implants,
textiles, space technology, and military applications. The concept of
a wireless charger for EVs, employing electromagnetic induction, is
central. Nikola Tesla's century-old vision of inductive power
transfer without a magnetic core inspires current advancements. The
research focuses on midrange wireless transfer capabilities,
emphasizing efficient wireless power transfer through factors like
resonance frequency alignment and non-radiative magnetic coupling
to reduce energy consumption for medium to long-range
transmission.
